        <h1>Taste of Thailand</h1>
        <p>Thailand is known for its delicious and diverse cuisine, which is heavily influenced by its
            <em>geography</em>
            and <em>culture</em>.
        </p>
        <p>The Thai cuisine is a perfect blend of <em>four seasonings</em>: <strong>salty, sweet, sour,</strong> and
            <strong>spicy.</strong>
        </p>

        <h4>What makes Thai food so different from other cuisines is <em>its use of contrasting flavors.</em></h4>
        <p>Thai food often pairs hot spices with sweet, light citrus flavors like <em>lime and mango</em>. The signature
            <strong>peanut sauce</strong> is somewhere between <em>sweet</em> and <em>savory</em> and adds depth to any
            dish.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup glutinous rice</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups water</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1 can coconut milk</li>
            <li>2 ripe mangoes, peeled and sliced</li>
        </ul>


        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse the glutinous rice in water several times until the water runs clear. Soak the rice in water for
                at
                least 2 hours or overnight.</li>
            <li>Drain the rice and add it to a saucepan with 1 1/2 cups of water. Bring the water to a boil, then reduce
                the
                heat to low and cover the pan with a lid. Cook the rice for 15-20 minutes, or until the water has been
                absorbed and the rice is tender.</li>
            <li>In a separate saucepan, combine the sugar, salt, and coconut milk. Heat the mixture over medium heat,
                stirring constantly, until the sugar has dissolved.</li>
            <li>Once the rice is cooked, remove it from the heat and add the coconut milk mixture. Stir the rice well to
                combine and let it sit for 5-10 minutes to absorb the liquid.</li>
            <li>Serve the sticky rice in bowls and top with sliced mango. </li>
