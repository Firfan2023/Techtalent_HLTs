            <h2>Gluten-Free Foods</h2>
            <h3>All you need to know about the gluten free diet that will make you well again!</h3>
            <p>Cutting out gluten from your diet may seem like a difficult and limiting task. <br><em>Fortunately</em>,
                there are
                many healthy and delicious foods that are <b>naturally gluten-free.</b></p>
            <p>The most <em>cost-effective and healthy</em> way to follow the gluten-free diet is to seek out these
                naturally
                gluten-free food groups, which include:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Fruits</li>
                <li>Vegetables</li>
                <li>Meat and poultry</li>
                <li>Fish and seafood</li>
                <li>Dairy
                <li>Beans, legumes, and nuts.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Pure wheat grass and barley grass are gluten-free, but there is gluten in the seeds. If they are not
                harvested or processed correctly, there is risk of gluten contamination.</p>

            <h3>What About Grains?</h3>

            <p>There are many naturally gluten-free grains that you can enjoy in a variety of creative ways.<br>Many of
                these grains can be found in your local grocery store, but some of the lesser-known grains may only be
                found in specialty or health food stores.<br> It is not recommended to purchase grains from bulk bins
                because of the possibility of cross-contact with gluten.</p>

            <h3>Naturally Gluten-Free Foods</h3>

            <p>The following grains, legumes, seeds, and other starchy foods are naturally gluten-free:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Beans</li>
                <li>Chia</li>
                <li>Corn</li>
                <li>Flax</li>
                <li>Millet</li>
                <li>Nut flours</li>
                <li>Potato</li>
                <li>Quinoa</li>
                <li>Rice</li>
                <li>Soy</li>
                <li>Tapioca</li>
            </ul>

            <p>There is some research indicating that some naturally gluten-free grains may contain gluten from
                cross-contact with gluten-containing grains through harvesting and processing.<br> If you are concerned
                about the safety of a grain, purchase only versions that are tested for the presence of gluten and
                contain <em>less than 20 parts per million</em>.</p>

            <h3>Gluten-Free Substitutes</h3>

            <p>Many items that usually contain gluten have gluten-free alternatives that are widely available in most
                grocery stores, making adherence to the gluten-free diet much easier.<br> Keep in mind, however, that
                minimally processed fresh foods are a crucial part of a healthy gluten-free diet.<br> It is very
                important
                to base your diet around fruits, vegetables, meats, and other healthy food groups listed above.<br>

                Many commercially-available products are labeled “gluten-free,” but there will be some that are not;
                this is why proper label reading is important.<br> It is also important to remember that “wheat-free”
                does
                not necessarily mean “gluten-free.” Be wary, as many products may appear to be gluten-free, but are not.

                <br>As a rule, traditional wheat products such as pastas, breads, crackers, and other baked goods are
                not
                gluten-free.<br> However, there are many gluten-free options available that use alternative flours and
                grains. Often, gluten-free bread can be found in the freezer section.<br> Additionally, there are
                gluten-free flours and flour blends available, allowing you to bake your own bread.
