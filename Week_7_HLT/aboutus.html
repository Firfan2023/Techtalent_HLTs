        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p> Celiac disease is one of the world's most prevalent genetic autoimmune diseases, affecting at least 1 in 100
            people in the UK and in Europe; however, only 36% of people with the condition are currently clinically
            diagnosed.<br> The average length of time taken for an adult to be diagnosed with the disease from the onset
            of
            symptoms is a staggering 13 years. Causing the body to attack its own small intestine, it can lead to many
            other
            devastating health conditions, including cancer.<br> Unfortunately for the millions who suffer, celiac
            disease has
            largely been ignored by our federal government which provides little to no funding for research nor for
            public
            awareness of its serious consequences.<br> Through strategic investments in research, education, and
            advocacy, the
            Celiac Disease Foundation seeks to remedy this by accelerating treatments and a cure.<br>

            Since its founding in 1990, the Celiac Disease Foundation has funded and executed international initiatives
            in
            three principal areas to bring an end to the suffering caused by celiac disease: medical research, patient
            and
            healthcare provider education, and public policy advocacy.</p>
