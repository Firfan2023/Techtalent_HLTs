            <img src="photos/gf_ypudding.png" width="200px" height="200px" alt="Gluten free Yorkshire Pudding image">

            <p>Gluten-free Yorkshire pudding recipe - the ONLY recipe you'll ever need and easy to make in a standard
                cupcake/muffin tray.<br> They rise beautifully and only need 3 ingredients! You can even make them dairy
                free
                too.</p>

            <h4>‚è≥30 mins, üßçServes 12</h4>



            <h3>Equipment</h3>
            <ul>
                <li> Muffin/cupcake tray.</li>
            </ul>


            <h3>Ingredients</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>200 g cornflour (cornstarch)</li>
                <li>6 eggs</li>
                <li>300 ml milk (dairy-free if necessary)</li>
                <li>50 ml cooking oil</li>

            </ul>
            <h3>Instructions</h3>

            <ol>

                <li>Preheat your oven to 220¬∞C/200¬∞C fan/425¬∞F.</li>
                <li>Add just around a tsp of oil to each of the holes in the muffin tin.</li>
                <li>Place your tin in the oven for 10-15 minutes until the oil is super hot, basically spitting!</li>
                <li>Whilst your oil is heating, beat/whisk your 6 eggs into your cornflour in a big mixing bowl.</li>
                <li>Once thoroughly combined, gradually add your milk a little at a time. Mix together - I use a
                    non-electric whisk for this.</li>
                <li>Pour your Yorkshire pudding batter into a jug so it's easier to pour into each hole.</li>
                <li>Next you need to be quick! Remove your muffin tray from the oven and immediately fill each hole with
                    your mixture until just under 3/4 full <br> (for really big yorkies or under half full for more
                    modest but equally epic yorkies!).<br> They should sizzle a little. Be very quick here and get them
                    back in the oven asap!</li>
                <li>Place back in the oven and bake for around 15-20 minutes until golden and risen. 
                    <br>!!!(NEVER open the oven door during their bake, this will ruin them!)</li>
                <li>Remove from your oven once cooked and serve up with a delicious roast dinner (lots of gravy!).</li>
                <li>Enjoy!</li>

            <h3>Ingredients</h3>

                <li>150 g butter melted</li>
                <li>75 g white chocolate chips</li>
                <li>Chocolate caramels as many as you have left in the chocolate box!</li>

            </ul>

            <h4>For the ganache layer:</h4>

            <ul>
                <li>150 g milk chocolate cut finely</li>
                <li>150 ml double cream</li>
                <li>Gold and bronze crunch sprinkles or any decoration you like!</li>

            </ul>

            <h3>Instructions</h3>

            <ol>

                <li>Prepare a square 8 or 9 inch tin with baking paper.<br> Leave a little excess so that you'll be able to
                    lift it out using the paper at the end.</li>
                <li>Make the choc chip cookie mix into dough as described on the packet.</li>
                <li>Once made into dough, spread it in your baking tin all the way to the edges.<br> I used my fingers to
                    push it carefully into a nice and flat, even layer. Try to get it as even as possible.</li>
                <li>Place it to chill in the fridge for 30 minutes or the freezer for about 15 minutes whilst you make
                    your brownie mix.</li>
                <li>Make your brownie mix as per the instructions.<br> Fold in some additional white chocolate chips once
                    it's looking nice and glossy and combined.</li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 160C Fan / 180C.</li>
                <li>Once the cookie dough is chilled, place some chocolate covered caramels on top of the cookie layer<br> - as many or as few as you like.</li>
                <li>Then pour the brownie mixture on top of it all and spread it to the edges.<br> Try to get this layer
                    really flat and even too.</li>
                <li>Cook in the oven for about 30 minutes, or until cooked right through.<br> Sometimes the centre can
                    take a little longer, so make sure you check with a skewer after the cook time is up.<br> I've found on
                    occasions it can take 45 minutes when I've used another oven!</li>
                <li>Once cooked allow to cool completely in the tin.</li>
                <li>When it's completely cooled, make a quick chocolate ganache.<br> Do this by chopping your chocolate very
                    finely with a shape knife (until almost flake like) and placing it in a bowl.</li>
                <li>Heat your double cream in a saucepan until just before boiling point.<br>Then pour over your flakey
                    chocolate. Make sure the cream covers the chocolate and then leave it without stirring for 5
                    minutes.</li>
                <li>After 5 minutes, stir the mixture until it combines and becomes smooth.</li>
                <li>Pour the ganache over the top of the now cooled baked brownie/cookie and spread it so it goes to all
                    the sides.<br> Again, get it as flat and even as possible.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle any decorations on top whilst the ganache is still wet.</li>
                <li>Then place the whole thing in the fridge (in the tin) for at least an hour until the ganache has
                    set.</li>
                <li>Remove from the tin and slice into squares.</li>
                <li>Enjoy!</li>
